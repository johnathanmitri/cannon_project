    <h1>Purpose</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this assignment was to create a game and refactor the given file canon.py into a program with emphasis on modularization and object oriented programming. To run the game, you have to ensure you have downloaded pygame and have both files my_colors.py and cannon.py and have all the .pngs downloaded and then you run canon.py</p>

    <h1>How the game works</h1>
    <p>How the game works: You keep shooting the targets and dodging until you die and your score is tracked. Everytime you kill all the targets that are on the screen, new targets respawn for you to shoot at and both tanks stay in the place where they were previously in. Note that the Algorithm tank is virtually impossible to kill because it is made to dodge whenever you shoot at it. Algorithm tank shoots once in every 2 seconds.</p>

        R key - Restart game <br>
        The x button at the top right corner of the game's window lets you close the game.</p>
